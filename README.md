# RforBiochemists201_sandpit
A repository for R for Biochemists 201 learners to play and learn

We can make changes to this file. 
And when we make changes, we should COMMIT them...

The next thing to learn is that we can FORK other peoples repositories. 
Then we can make changes. 
Again, we need to COMMIT these changes. 

# We need to be careful to keep up to date with the Upstream repository.... 


To play with this sandpit...
- Fork it into your own Github area. 
- Make change
- Commit the change
- Create a pull request...
- If you come back and make more changes later... please Fetch upstream to keep your repo up to date...

You could also add a link to your R-story if you have made one. 
Have a go and see how you manage.
